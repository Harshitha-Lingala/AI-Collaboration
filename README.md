# AI-Collaboration

## Overview

The **AI-Collaboration** project integrates three primary agents:

1. **Researcher Agent**
2. **Developer Agent**
   - Currently, the Developer is using the GPT model before fine-tuning.
   - The model should be fine-tuned for improved performance.
3. **Tester Agent**

The **`Orchestrator.py`** script serves as the central link that connects all the agents and facilitates their interaction.
