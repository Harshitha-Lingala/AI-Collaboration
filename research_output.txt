- For the IRIS Dataset machine learning model, the following techniques are recommended:
  - Preprocessing Steps:
    - Data Pre-processing involving fixing missing data cells and encoding categorical data.
    - Efficient techniques for preprocessing the IRIS Dataset with libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
    - Summarized preprocessing steps including data loading, splitting, scaling, and encoding.
  - Algorithms:
    - Implementing common supervised learning algorithms like decision trees, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors for classification tasks.
    - Performance comparison of different classification algorithms from scikit-learn on the Iris dataset.
    - Selecting algorithms based on the problem requirements and evaluating them with Iris dataset features.
