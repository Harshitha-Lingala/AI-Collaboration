The script has the following issues:

1. Syntax errors: 
   - The parameter name for LogisticRegression is incorrect. It should be 'penalty' instead of 'penaltyy'. 

2. Logical issues: 
   - There are no logical issues in the script.

3. Runtime problems: 
   - The script will fail at runtime when trying to initialize the LogisticRegression classifier due to the incorrect parameter name.

4. Improperly initialized components: 
   - The LogisticRegression classifier is improperly initialized due to the incorrect parameter name.

5. Incorrect method calls: 
   - There are no incorrect method calls in the script.

6. Missing dependencies: 
   - There are no missing dependencies in the script.

7. Unused modules: 
   - There are no unused modules in the script.

Corrected Script:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.datasets import load_files

# Load the IMDB dataset
reviews = load_files('path_to_imdb_dataset', categories=['pos', 'neg'])

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(reviews.data, reviews.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')

# Fit and transform the training data
X_train_counts = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform the testing data
X_test_counts = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Initialize the Logistic Regression classifier
clf = LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', random_state=42)

# Fit the classifier on the training data
clf.fit(X_train_counts, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_counts)

# Calculate the accuracy of the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```
