The script contains the following issues:

1. Logical Issues: The path to the IMDB dataset is not specified. It is written as 'path_to_imdb_dataset', which is a placeholder. The correct path to the dataset should be provided.

2. Incorrect Method Calls: There is a typo in the parameter of the LogisticRegression() function. The parameter 'penaltyy' should be 'penalty'.

3. Runtime Problems: The script will fail at the line where the LogisticRegression() function is called due to the incorrect parameter name 'penaltyy'. It should be 'penalty'.

The corrected script should look like this:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.datasets import load_files

# Load the IMDB dataset
reviews = load_files('correct_path_to_imdb_dataset', categories=['pos', 'neg'])

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(reviews.data, reviews.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')

# Fit and transform the training data
X_train_counts = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform the testing data
X_test_counts = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Initialize the Logistic Regression classifier
clf = LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', random_state=42)

# Fit the classifier on the training data
clf.fit(X_train_counts, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_counts)

# Calculate the accuracy of the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

Note: Replace 'correct_path_to_imdb_dataset' with the actual path to your IMDB dataset.
