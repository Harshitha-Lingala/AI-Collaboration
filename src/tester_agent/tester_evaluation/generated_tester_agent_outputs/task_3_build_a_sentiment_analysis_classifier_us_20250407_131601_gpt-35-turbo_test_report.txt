Overall, the script seems to be well-written with only one issue identified:

1. Logical Issue:
   - In the line where the Logistic Regression classifier is initialized, there is a typo in the parameter name 'penaltyy' instead of 'penalty'. This will cause a runtime error as the parameter name is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the parameter name should be corrected to 'penalty' as shown below:
```python
# Initialize the Logistic Regression classifier
clf = LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', random_state=42)
```

Other than that, the script appears to be free of syntax errors, runtime problems, improperly initialized components, incorrect method calls, missing dependencies, and unused modules.
