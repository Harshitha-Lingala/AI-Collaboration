The script appears to be mostly fine, but there are some potential issues:

1. API_KEY: It is mentioned as "your_api_key", this needs to be replaced with the actual API key from OpenWeatherMap. It might be better to fetch this from an environment variable or a secure location instead of hardcoding it, to avoid accidentally committing it to a repository.

2. Temperature unit: The OpenWeatherMap API returns the temperature in Kelvin by default, but the CSV file is expecting it in Celsius. The API allows you to specify the unit you want by adding "&units=metric" (for Celsius) or "&units=imperial" (for Fahrenheit) to the URL.

3. Error handling: While the script checks the HTTP status code, it does not handle other potential errors. For example, if the 'name', 'main', 'temp', or 'humidity' keys are not present in the response, the script will crash with a KeyError. It would be better to use the dict.get() method, which allows you to specify a default value if the key is not present.

4. Unused modules: All imported modules are used, no issues here.

5. Incorrect method calls: All method calls seem to be correct.

6. Missing dependencies: The script seems to have all necessary dependencies. However, it assumes that the 'requests' module is installed, which might not be the case in a fresh Python environment. It would be good to mention this in a comment or a README file.

7. Improperly initialized components: No improperly initialized components. The API_KEY and CITY variables are properly initialized at the beginning of the script.

Here's a modified version of the script:

```python
import requests
import csv
import os

API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENWEATHER_API_KEY')
CITY = "London"
URL = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={CITY}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric"

response = requests.get(URL)

if response.status_code != 200:
    print("Error fetching weather data")
    exit()

weather_data = response.json()

with open('weather_data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["City", "Temperature (C)", "Humidity (%)"])
    writer.writerow([weather_data.get('name', ''), weather_data.get('main', {}).get('temp', ''), weather_data.get('main', {}).get('humidity', '')])

print("Weather data saved to weather_data.csv")
```

In this version, the API key is fetched from an environment variable, the API is asked to return the temperature in Celsius, and the dict.get() method is used to prevent KeyErrors.
