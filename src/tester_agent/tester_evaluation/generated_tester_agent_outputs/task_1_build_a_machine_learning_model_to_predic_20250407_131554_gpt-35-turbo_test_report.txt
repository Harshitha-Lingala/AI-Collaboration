The script appears to be well-written with no syntax errors. However, there are some logical issues and a runtime problem that need to be addressed:

1. Intentional Bug: The script intentionally drops the 'CRIM' feature from the dataset. This is not a good practice as it introduces bias and could affect the performance of the model. It should be removed to ensure the model is trained on all available features.

2. Unused 'boston' variable: The variable 'boston' is loaded but never used in the script. It can be removed to clean up the code.

3. Missing Dependency: The script imports necessary libraries for machine learning tasks, but it does not import the necessary library for dropping the 'CRIM' feature. The script should import 'pandas' library to use the 'drop' function.

4. Improperly Initialized Components: The script does not handle missing values in the dataset. It is important to check for missing values and handle them appropriately before training the model.

5. Incorrect Method Call: The script calls 'model.predict(X_test)' to make predictions, which is correct. However, it does not include any code to save or export the model for future use.

Overall, the script is functional but could be improved by addressing the mentioned issues.
