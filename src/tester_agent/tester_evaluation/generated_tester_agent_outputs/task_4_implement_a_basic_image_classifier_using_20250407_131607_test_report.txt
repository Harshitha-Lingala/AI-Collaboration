The script seems to be correct in terms of syntax and logic. There are no runtime problems, improperly initialized components, incorrect method calls, missing dependencies, or unused modules. The reviewer has pointed out two potential issues but they seem to be incorrect:

1. The comment suggests that the input channel in the first convolutional layer (self.conv1) is incorrect and should be 3. However, the input channel is indeed already set to 3, which is appropriate for a 3-channel color image like those in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

2. The comment suggests that the model instance is missing, but the model is correctly instantiated with the line "model = CNN()".

Therefore, there are no actual issues with this script. The comments indicating bugs are incorrect. The script should be able to perform the task of training a simple convolutional neural network on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
