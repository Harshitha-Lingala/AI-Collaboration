The script does not have any syntax errors, but it does have some logical issues and potential runtime problems.

1. Logical Issues:

   - The URL is hardcoded, which limits the script's usability. It would be better to design the script to accept the URL as an argument or an input.

   - The CSS selector '.product-name' is used to extract product titles. If the structure of the webpage changes or if the script is used on a different webpage, this selector might not work. It would be better to make the CSS selector a configurable parameter, or at least verify that elements with this class exist on the page before trying to select them.

2. Runtime Problems:

   - There is no exception handling for the requests.get() call. If the request fails for any reason (like network issues, server downtime, invalid URL), the script will crash. It would be better to wrap this in a try/except block to handle potential HTTP errors or a requests.exceptions.RequestException.

3. Improperly Initialized Components, Incorrect Method Calls, Missing Dependencies, Unused Modules:

   - All the modules that are imported are used, and there don't appear to be any missing dependencies. The methods called on the response and soup objects are correct according to the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.

   - There are no improperly initialized components in this script. The url, response, soup, and product_titles variables are all initialized correctly.

Here's a revised version of the script with exception handling and the URL as an input:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_product_titles(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print ("Error: ",err)
        return
    else:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        product_titles = soup.select('.product-name')

        for title in product_titles:
            print(title.text.strip())

url = input("Please enter the URL: ")
scrape_product_titles(url)
```
