The script seems to be free from syntax errors, runtime problems, improperly initialized components, incorrect method calls, missing dependencies, and unused modules. However, the script does have some logical issues and poor practices.

Logical issues:
1. The URL is hardcoded. This is not necessarily a bug, but it does limit the script's flexibility. Ideally, the script should be able to take a URL as an input parameter.

Poor practices:
1. The script does not handle potential exceptions that may occur during the request. If the website is down or the URL is incorrect, the script will crash. It would be better to use a try-except block to handle these potential issues.

2. The script assumes that the CSS selector for product titles is '.product-name'. If the website changes its layout or if the script is used on a different website, this selector may not work. It would be better to take the CSS selector as an input parameter.

Here is a revised version of the script:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_product_titles(url, css_selector):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return

    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    product_titles = soup.select(css_selector)

    for title in product_titles:
        print(title.text.strip())

# Example usage:
scrape_product_titles('https://www.example-ecommerce-site.com', '.product-name')
```

This version of the script takes a URL and a CSS selector as input parameters, and it handles potential exceptions that may occur during the request.
