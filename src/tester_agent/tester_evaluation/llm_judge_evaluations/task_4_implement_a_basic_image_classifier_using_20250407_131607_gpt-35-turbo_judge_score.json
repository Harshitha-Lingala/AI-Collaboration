  "comments": "The review accurately identified the issues in the script, including the intentional bug in the CNN model and the missing model instance initialization. However, the review could have been more helpful by suggesting the correct input channel number and providing a code snippet for proper model initialization. The coverage was good, but the review missed to suggest the addition of a validation loop and evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance."
