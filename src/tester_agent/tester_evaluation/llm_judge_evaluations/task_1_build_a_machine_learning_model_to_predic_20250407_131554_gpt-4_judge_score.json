  "comments": "The review is accurate in identifying the intentional bug of dropping the 'CRIM' feature. It provides helpful suggestions on improving the script, such as saving the model, conducting exploratory data analysis, error handling, and visualizing results. However, the review missed to comment on the lack of validation set for model tuning, which is a common practice in machine learning projects."
