  "comments": "The tester agent did an excellent job of identifying the issues in the script. It correctly pointed out the hardcoded URL and CSS selector, as well as the lack of exception handling. The revised script provided by the tester is much more robust and flexible. The tester's review was accurate, helpful, and covered all the major issues."
