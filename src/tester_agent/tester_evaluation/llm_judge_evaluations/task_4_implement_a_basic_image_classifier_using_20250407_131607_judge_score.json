  "comments": "The tester agent correctly identified that the comments in the script were incorrect and that there were no actual issues with the script. However, the review could have been more helpful if it provided more explanation about why the input channel and model instantiation were correct. Additionally, the review could have covered other potential issues, such as the lack of validation or testing of the model after training."
