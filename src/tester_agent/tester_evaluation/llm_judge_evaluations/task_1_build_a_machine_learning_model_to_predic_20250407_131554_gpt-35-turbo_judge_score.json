  "comments": "The review correctly identifies the intentional bug of dropping the 'CRIM' feature, and it's helpful to suggest removing it. However, the 'boston' variable is actually used to create the 'data' DataFrame, so it's not unused. The script does import the 'pandas' library, so the claim about a missing dependency is incorrect. The comment about missing values is valid, but there's no evidence in the script that the dataset has missing values. The suggestion about saving or exporting the model is helpful, but not a requirement for every script. The review missed the fact that the script does not visualize or print out any characteristics of the data or the model, which could be useful for understanding the model's performance."
