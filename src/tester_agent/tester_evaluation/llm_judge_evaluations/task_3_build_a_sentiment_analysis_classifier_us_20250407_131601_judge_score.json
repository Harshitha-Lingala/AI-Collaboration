  "comments": "The tester correctly identified the issue with the incorrect parameter name in the LogisticRegression function. The provided correction is helpful and would fix the issue. However, the review could have been more comprehensive in terms of suggesting improvements for the script, such as error handling for loading the dataset or checking the shapes of the data after splitting. The tester didn't miss any major issues but could have provided more insights on potential improvements."
