  "comments": "The tester provided a good review, correctly identifying that the script is logically sound and that there are no syntax errors. The tester also correctly pointed out potential runtime problems if the API key is not provided. However, the tester could have been more helpful by suggesting error handling for potential network issues or invalid API responses. The coverage of the review is comprehensive, touching on all aspects of the script."
