  "comments": "The review accurately identified the intentional bug of dropping the 'CRIM' feature and provided a helpful suggestion on how to fix it. It also correctly noted that whether this is a bug or not depends on the task requirements. The review covered all parts of the script, but it could have been more helpful by suggesting ways to improve the model's performance or addressing potential overfitting."
