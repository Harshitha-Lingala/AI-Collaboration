  "comments": "The tester accurately identified the issues in the script, including the hardcoded URL, lack of exception handling, and potential problems with the CSS selector. The suggestions provided were helpful and meaningful, including making the URL an input, adding exception handling, and considering making the CSS selector a configurable parameter. The revised script was a useful addition. However, the tester did not mention the potential issue of the script not checking if any elements were returned by the CSS selector before trying to print their text, which could cause a runtime error if no elements were found."
