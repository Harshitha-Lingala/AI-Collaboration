- Recommended Algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
  - Decision Tree Classifier

- Preprocessing Steps:
  - Fixing missing data-cells in the dataset
  - Encoding Categorical Data (if applicable)
  - Data normalization or scaling
  - Feature selection or dimensionality reduction (if necessary)
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

- Model Types:
  - Classification models are suitable for the IRIS Dataset, such as logistic regression, KNN, and decision trees, as it is a classification problem.
