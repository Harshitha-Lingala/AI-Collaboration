The Python script provided seems to be well-written without any obvious syntax errors, logical issues, or runtime problems. It has properly initialized components, correct method calls, and no missing dependencies or unused modules. 

However, there are a few points that could be improved or added for a more comprehensive and robust script:

1. Exception Handling: The script could benefit from more comprehensive exception handling. Currently, it only handles the case where the file 'iris.csv' is not found. It could also handle other potential errors, such as a PermissionError if the script doesn't have the right permissions to read the file, or a pd.errors.ParserError if the file is not a correctly formatted CSV.

2. Data Validation: The script assumes that the 'species' column exists and that it's the target variable. It would be good to add some validation to ensure that the 'species' column contains categorical data, and to handle the case where it might not.

3. Model Validation: While the script does print the accuracy and classification report for each model, it could also include some form of model validation, such as cross-validation, to give a better estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data.

4. Random Seed: For reproducibility, it's a good practice to set a seed for the random number generator, which is used in the train_test_split function.

5. Imputation vs Deletion: The script deletes any rows with missing values. Depending on the nature and amount of the missing data, it might be more appropriate to impute missing values rather than deleting them.

6. Comments: While the script has good comments, it could benefit from more detailed comments explaining why certain steps are being taken, especially for beginners who might use this script to learn.

7. Saving the Model: After training the models, it would be useful to add code to save the trained models for future use. This could be done using joblib or pickle libraries in Python.
